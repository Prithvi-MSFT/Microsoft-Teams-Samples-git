# Typeahead search control in Adaptive Cards C#

This sample shows the feature of typeahead search (static and dynamic) control in Adaptive Cards.

## Interaction with app

![Typedsearch Module](TypeaheadSearch/Images/TypedSearchModule.gif) 

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 3.1

  determine dotnet version
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (For local environment testing) Latest (any other tunneling software can also be used)  
 
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account

## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
	- Register a AAD aap registration in Azure portal.
	- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-               registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
      - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

	```bash
	# ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
	```   
4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
 - Modify the `appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
   - `MicrosoftAppId` - Generated from Step 1 (Application (client) ID)is the application app id
   - `MicrosoftAppPassword` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
   
  - Open the code in Visual Studio
   - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
   - Navigate to folder where repository is cloned then `samples/bot-type-ahead-search-adaptive-cards/csharp/TypeaheadSearch.sln`
   - Press `F5` to run the project
	 
5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./AppPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok.io` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok.io`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `AppPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

   
## Running the sample

Use the bot command `staticsearch` to get the card with static typeahead search control and use bot command `dynamicsearch` to get the card with dynamic typeahead search control.

`Static search:`
 Static typeahead search allows users to search from values specified within `input.choiceset` in the Adaptive Card payload.

`Dynamic search:`
 Dynamic typeahead search is useful to search and select data from large data sets. The data sets are loaded dynamically from the dataset specified in the card payload.

`On `Submit` button click, the bot will return the choice that we have selected:`
