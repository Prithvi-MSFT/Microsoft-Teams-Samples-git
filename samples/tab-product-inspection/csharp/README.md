## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunneling solution

## Setup.
  
1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

  - Register a AAD aap registration in Azure portal.
  - Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
  - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
  
    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
  - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

	```bash
	# ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
	```

4. Setup for code

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
- Build your solution

  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `samples/tab-product-inspection/csharp/ProductInspection` folder
  - Select `ProductInspection.csproj` file
  - Press `F5` to run the project

   - Zip all three files present in manifest folder
   
5. Setup Manifest for Teams

    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./Manifest folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok.io` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok.io`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `Manifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
